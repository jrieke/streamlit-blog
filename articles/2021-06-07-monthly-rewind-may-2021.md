## ****🏆 App of the** m**onth 🏆****

Our May featured app of the month is......🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁

[Worst-Case Analysis for Feature Rollouts](https://share.streamlit.io/crosstabkite/worst-case-analysis/app.py?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by The [Crosstab Kite](https://www.crosstab.io/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) team.  
  
This app shows a Bayesian analysis of a simulated [staged rollout experiment*.*](https://www.crosstab.io/articles/staged-rollout-analysis?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) It was built as a demo to arguably show a method better than confidence intervals for this process.
