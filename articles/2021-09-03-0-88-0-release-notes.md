Hey Streamlit Fam! 👋

Say hello to a notable new feature in the 0.88.0 release: `st.download_button`. Now your viewers can download data **right from your Streamlit apps**!

In this post, we'll go into more detail about the new download button and other updates.

Want to jump right in? [Here's](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/release-demos/0.88/0.88/streamlit_app.py?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) a sample app and [here are](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=download+button&ref=streamlit.ghost.io#streamlit.download_button) the docs.

# ✨ Release Highlight

## ⬇️ Download Button

Before this release, you had to hack your way to the download functionality within Streamlit. None of the hacks were great. And they didn't play well with the [Streamlit Cloud platform](https://streamlit.io/cloud?ref=streamlit.ghost.io).

With `st.download_button` you can use the download functionality both locally and within our cloud platform.

Curious how it's built?

### **API Details**

**`streamlit.download_button(label, data, file_name=None, mime=None, key=None, help=None, on_click=None, args=None, kwargs=None)`**

This will display a button for your viewers so they can download data locally to their machines.

### **Parameters**

* **`label`** (*`str`*) – A short label explaining to the user what this button is for.
* **`data`** (*`str` or `bytes` or `file`*) – The contents of the file to be downloaded.
* **`file_name`** (*`str`*) - An optional string to use as the name of the file to be downloaded, eg. 'my\_file.csv'. If file\_name is not specified, a name will be automatically generated.
* **`mime`** (*`str` or `None`*) – The MIME type of the data. If data=str and MIME is unspecified, then MIME defaults to “text/plain”. If data=bytes and MIME is unspecified, then MIME defaults to “application/octet-stream”.
* **`key`** (*`str`*) – An optional string to use as the unique key for the widget. If you omit this, a key will be generated for the widget based on its content. Multiple widgets of the same type may not share the same key.
* **`help`** (*`str`*) – An optional tooltip that gets displayed when the button is hovered over.
* **`on_click`** (*`callable`*) – An optional callback invoked when this button is clicked.
* **`args`** (*`tuple`*) – An optional tuple of args to pass to the callback.
* **kwargs** (*`dict`*) – An optional dict of kwargs to pass to the callback.

### **Returns**

If the button was clicked on the last run of the app, it will be True. Otherwise, it will be False. Additionally, the return type is `bool`.

### **Example Usage**

```
# Text files

text_contents = '''
Foo, Bar
123, 456
789, 000
'''

# Different ways to use the API

st.download_button('Download CSV', text_contents, 'text/csv')
st.download_button('Download CSV', text_contents)  # Defaults to 'text/plain'

with open('myfile.csv') as f:
	st.download_button('Download CSV', f)  # Defaults to 'text/plain'

# ---
# Binary files

binary_contents = b'whatever'

# Different ways to use the API

st.download_button('Download file', binary_contents)  # Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'

with open('myfile.zip', 'rb') as f:
	st.download_button('Download Zip', f, file_name='archive.zip')  # Defaults to 'application/octet-stream'

# You can also grab the return value of the button,
# just like with any other button.

if st.download_button(...):
	st.write('Thanks for downloading!')
```

# 🧩 Other notable updates

Below are some other notable updates on this release:

* 🛑 We made changes to improve the redacted exception experience on Streamlit Cloud. When `client.showErrorDetails=true` exceptions display the Error Type and Traceback, the actual error text will be redacted to prevent data leaks. [[3713](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3713?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)]
* 🖥️ Macs are set to verify SSL in Python. If certificates aren't installed, a `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` error propagates. We removed HTTPS in order to solve this issue. [[3744](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3744?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)]
* 🔑 Integers can now also be used as keys in widget declarations. This helps community members who use integers for keys. This change ensures integer keys are converted to strings. [[3697](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3697?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)]
