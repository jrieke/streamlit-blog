### What is 30 days of Streamlit?

We're kicking off `#30DaysOfStreamlit`—a social challenge for getting up to speed on building and deploying Streamlit apps. Each day a new challenge will be released for participants to tackle. Inspired by Ken Jee’s `#66daysofdata`, the `#100daysofcode` challenge, and Kaggle’s `#30DaysofML`, this initiative is a fun opportunity to learn, create, share, and earn.  
  
👉 Check out the [app](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/30days?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) to get started now!

### Content

The challenge will move through three levels of difficulty: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

📆 Days 1-7 will cover beginner tasks such as setting up a local and cloud coding environment, installing the Streamlit library, and building your first Streamlit Hello World app.

📆 Days 8-23 will cover more intermediate topics. Each day may highlight a Streamlit command to use for creating and deploying a simple Streamlit app (e.g., build a simple app that uses the `st.download_button` command).

📆 Days 24-30 will enter more advanced subjects. Learn about session states and things like efficient data and memory handling for Streamlit apps.
