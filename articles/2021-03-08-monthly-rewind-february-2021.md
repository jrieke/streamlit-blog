## 🏆 App of the month 🏆

Our February featured app of the month is......🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁

[Bayesian Deep Learning for Galaxy Zoo DECaLS](https://share.streamlit.io/mwalmsley/galaxy-poster/gz_decals_mike_walmsley.py?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by Mike Walmsley.   
  
From 2015-2020, [Galaxy Zoo](https://blog.galaxyzoo.org/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) volunteers made 1.8 million detailed classifications of 314,000 DECaLS galaxies. This app allows you to explore that data and predicts morphology posteriors. [[code](https://github.com/mwalmsley/galaxy-poster/blob/master/gz_decals_mike_walmsley.py?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)]
