Hey Community 👋,

We’ve recently rolled out a new type of release, our Nightly Build, and we wanted to give everyone a bit of information about it.

****What is nightly?****

Nightly is a new style of release we created for anyone who wants the most up-to-date Streamlit version. At the end of each day, all PRs that were approved will be added to a new nightly build, including all of our newest features! While we can’t guarantee there won’t be bugs, all nightly versions go through the same automated portion of testing as our general releases. If you’d like to use, simply do `pip install streamlit-nightly` or if there is a specific version of nightly you want to use, you can [find it here](https://pypi.org/project/streamlit-nightly/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io#history). All changes can be found using the [comparison tool](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/compare/0.57.3...0.57.4.dev20200412?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) on our GitHub repo.

****Why are we doing this?****

We want to make sure you have access to the latest features and fixes as soon as they are available. If there was an issue preventing you from using Streamlit or you need a feature that will allow you to do more, this will give quicker access. It will also let you try things out sooner and give us valuable feedback!

Let us know if you have any feedback or questions ❤️
