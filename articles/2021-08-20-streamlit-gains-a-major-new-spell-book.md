I remember a CS professor of mine pointing out that **most of the magic in Harry Potter can now be done on computers**! Images dance on our digital newspapers. Cellphones swirl with memories like portable Pensieves. Computer classes are our Charms. Algorithms are our Arithmancy!

If computing departments are the new Hogwarts, **then technical tomes are the new spell books**. The best works brim with technical secrets and arcana, and represent a totem to some branch of our magical field: Python. Algorithms. Visualization. Machine learning.

I'm therefore particularly excited and proud to share that **Streamlit has a major new book**, lovingly written by one of our own [Streamlit Creators](https://streamlit.io/creators?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) (and Facebook data scientist) Tyler Richards.

This is a true spell book. Yes, other books teach Streamlit, but this is the first which captures the *essence* of Streamlit. The book demonstrates how **Streamlit is transforming the very *definition* of data science and machine learning**.

Throughout the 2010s, data science and machine learning had two basic outputs. On the one hand, you could use a notebook environment to create static analyses. On the other, you could deploy complete machine learning models into production. **Streamlit opened up a new middle way** between these two: interactive apps that let you *play* with analyses and share models interactively throughout an organization.

[Getting Started with Streamlit for Data Science](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Streamlit-Data-Science-ebook/dp/B095Z1R3BP?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) teaches you how to master this new superpower. You start by creating a basic analysis and work your way up to complete Streamlit apps with fancy graphics and interactive machine learning models.

So go [pick up your copy](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Streamlit-Data-Science-ebook/dp/B095Z1R3BP?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)!
