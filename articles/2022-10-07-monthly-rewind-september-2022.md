## ****🏆 App of the** m**onth 🏆****

Our September featured app of the month is... 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  
  
[Abstractonator](https://abstractonator.labs.crossref.org/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by Crossref Labs!  
  
This app is a game that tests if you can distinguish machine-generated content (MGC) from human-generated content (HGC). Try to guess which scholarly abstracts are the human-generated originals and which are AI-generated! [[code](https://gitlab.com/crossref/abstractonator?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)]
