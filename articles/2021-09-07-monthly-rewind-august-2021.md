## ****🏆 App of the** m**onth 🏆****

Our August featured app of the month is......🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁

[Parking Spot Vacancy](https://share.streamlit.io/rejexx/parkingspot_vacancy/main/src/streamlit_app.py?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by [Jeffrey Jex](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffreyjex/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io).

Wanna know how many parking spots are available at the Jackson Hole Wyoming Town Square before making the trip? This app takes a live stream of the area and and processes it with Mask R-CNN to detect cars and trucks. It then compares locations with parking places to see which are available.
