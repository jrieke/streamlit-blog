[*Fast Prototyping of GenAI Apps with Streamlit*](https://www.coursera.org/learn/fast-prototyping-of-genai-apps-with-streamlit?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) is created as part of a Snowflake × DeepLearning.AI collaboration.

The course tackles a costly problem: app ideas lose momentum when they linger in discussions, drawn-out specifications, and intangibles that slow down the decision-making process. In a field where new GenAI capabilities surface every week, the teams that can show working demos *first* are the ones that influence roadmaps and win resources.

## **What you'll learn**

This course gives you that speed advantage.

We'll first kick off with an insightful conversation between Chanin Nantasenamat, PhD (the course instructor) and Professor Andrew Ng. We discussed how GenAI has fundamentally changed app development by enabling developers to build and test ideas faster than ever before.

You’ll explore how GenAI streamlines the prototyping workflow, facilitates rapid iteration and validation of product-market fit, and allows anyone, regardless of coding experience, to participate in the application development process.

You’ll learn how to turn a few lines of Python into a shareable [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) web app, cut down iteration time from weeks to hours using Snowflake’s secure data and coding copilot, and improve the performance of your application easily using [Snowflake’s Cortex AI](https://www.snowflake.com/en/product/features/cortex/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io), a fully managed suite of LLMs, RAG, and text-to-SQL services (free 120-day trial included).

You’ll start with a basic chatbot, layer on prompt engineering and RAG, and publish the result to Snowflake or Streamlit Community Cloud for real-time feedback.

By the end of the course, you’ll leave with a working GenAI app, a repeatable MVP-first framework, and the skills to validate any new idea as soon as it strikes.
