Note: Streamlit Cloud is now Streamlit Community Cloud.

Hey Streamlit Fam! 👋

We're excited to introduce the 0.89.0 release with two notable updates: new **configurable hamburger menu options** and new **experimental primitives for caching**.

In this post, we'll describe them in detail and talk about other updates. If you can't wait to try them out—here's a [sample app](https://share.streamlit.io/streamlit/release-demos/0.89/0.89/streamlit_app.py?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)!

# **✨ New in Streamlit**

## 🍔 **Configurable hamburger menu options**

We worked on improving the in-app menu (or as we like to call it internally, the hamburger menu 🍔):

* **Make the menu more useful to viewers.** The About menu shows information about Streamlit, but viewers want to see information about the app itself!
* **Reduce confusion.** Menu items used to change depending on where the app was hosted. Not anymore.
* **Continue to provide developer-oriented options**, such as clear cache.

To address the above, we're introducing two updates:

1. A new API to customize the menu.
2. A context-aware visual redesign.

Let's jump right in.

## 1. New API to customize the menu

`st.set_page_config` now accepts the `menu_options` argument to allow you to configure or remove **Get help**, **Report a bug**, and **About** menu items.

Here it is in action:

```
menu_items = {
	'Get help': YOUR_HELP_URL_STRING,
	'Report a bug': YOUR_BUG_PAGE_URL_STRING,
	'About': '''
	 ## My Custom App

	 Some markdown to show in the About dialog.
	'''
}

st.set_page_config(menu_items=menu_items)
```

And here is the About menu with Markdown (it's as simple as copying your README.md from the app repo into the tab):

![about-menu](https://streamlit.ghost.io/content/images/2021/09/about-menu.jpeg)

You can disable menu items by setting `None` as the menu item's value. For more information, see [the documentation for](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/stable/api.html?highlight=set_page_config&ref=streamlit.ghost.io#streamlit.set_page_config) `set_page_config` .

## 2. Context-aware visual redesign

The hamburger menu is now divided into the main section (visible to everyone) and the developer section (visible to developers only).

The developer section is context-aware. It appears if the app is running on `localhost` or if it was deployed in Streamlit Cloud (and if the current user is the app's developer).

Here is what it looks like:

That's it for the hamburger menu! 🍔

## ⚙️ **New experimental primitives for caching**

Two years ago, we introduced `st.cache` as the foundational part of Streamlit's execution model. It lets you write apps linearly—like a simple script without sacrificing performance.

But this powerful tool came with unexpected complexity (did anyone say hashfuncs 🤯?). `st.cache` tried to solve *too many problems* at the same time.

Today we're introducing two experimental primitives that focus on specific use-cases of `st.cache`: `st.experimental_memo` and `st.experimental_singleton`.

**We're releasing these features early because we want to get your feedback!**

Please give them a try and take it to the forums with bugs, thoughts, and (hopefully) praise. And don't worry. None of this will impact your ability to use the current `st.cache`. 😄

Here is how these primitives work:

### `st.experimental_memo`

Use it to store expensive computation which can be "cached" or "memoized" in the traditional sense. It has the same API as the existing `st.cache`:

```
@st.experimental_memo
def load_csv(filename):
    df = pd.read_csv(filename)
    return df

df = load_csv('my-data.csv')
```

It's that simple! See [this blog post](https://streamlit.ghost.io/new-experimental-primitives-for-caching/) for more information.

### `st.experimental_singleton`

This is a key-value store that's shared across all Streamlit app sessions. Use it for storing objects that are initialized once but are used multiple times throughout your app (like Tensorflow sessions and database connections):

```
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

@st.singleton
def get_db_sessionmaker():
    # This is for illustration purposes only
    DB_URL = "your-db-url"
    engine = create_engine(DB_URL)
    return sessionmaker(engine)
```

That's it for `st.experimental_memo` and `st.experimental_singleton`! Read [this blog post](https://streamlit.ghost.io/new-experimental-primitives-for-caching/) for more details.

We're excited to see what you do with these new primitives. To use them, upgrade Streamlit as usual:

```
pip install --upgrade streamlit
```

# 👟 **Other notable updates**

* 💅 We've updated our UI to a more polished look to improve typography, vertical rhythm, and so much more (including our favorite, the UI for dataframes!)
* 🎨 We now support `theme.base` in the theme object when it's sent to custom components. [[3737](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3737?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)].
* 🧠 We've modified session state to reset widgets if any of their arguments changed (even if they provide a key). Some widget behavior has changed as result, but these are a minority of cases. Besides, we find this is the best API both in theory and in practice. See [docs](https://docs.streamlit.io/en/0.89.0/advanced_widget_behavior.html?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) for more.
* 🐞 Bug fixes: `st.image` now supports SVG URLs [[#3809](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3809?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)] and SVG strings that don't start with an <svg> tag [[#3789](https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/pull/3789?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)].
