## ****🏆 App of the** m**onth 🏆****

Our January featured app of the month is... 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  
  
[MathGPT](https://mathgpt.streamlit.app/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by José Manuel Nápoles Duarte!  
  
MathGPT is an app that uses Open AI's GPT-3 and NumPy to handle mathematical operations—such as vectors, matrices, and even college physics problems. Enter a prompt involving a math operation and get the result, explanation, and code behind the solution.
