Our October featured app of the month is... 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  
  
[Sophisticated Palette](https://sophisticated-palette.streamlit.app/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by Siavash Yasini!  
  
This app creates color palettes from famous artwork or any image of your choice! Simply choose an image and get inspiration for the colors of your projects. You can adjust the colors of the image and customize the palette and sample pixel size. Copy the code snippet provided in the app to adopt the colors into your matplotlib and plotly charts.
