## ****🏆 App of the** m**onth 🏆****

Our June featured app of the month is... 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁

[Learning log](https://tylerhillery-learning-log-streamlit-app-p6ig3y.streamlitapp.com/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by Tyler Hillery!   
  
Inspired by GitHub's contribution graphs, Tyler created this app to track the time he spends on learning. You can see the date of the learning session, the length of time, what was studied and where, along with his contextual notes. The app keeps Tyler accountable to his learning goals and helps visualize his progress! [[code](https://github.com/TylerHillery/learning-log?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)]
