## ****🏆 App of the** m**onth 🏆****

Our November featured app of the month is... 🥁🥁🥁🥁🥁  
  
[Song Describer](https://song-describer.streamlit.app/?ref=streamlit.ghost.io) by researchers Ilaria Manco, Benno Weck, Philip Tovstogan, Dmitry Bogdanov, and Minz Won.  
  
This app is an open-source data collection platform for annotating music with textual descriptions. By collecting user inputs, the team hopes to create the first research dataset of music-caption pairs. This will give insight into how people describe music and support the development of audio-text ML models. [[code](https://github.com/ilaria-manco/song-describer?ref=streamlit.ghost.io)]
